If you are usually a full size please purchase this style in your regular size. If you are sometimes in-between sizes we recommend you go down rather than up . In industry terms LX-U shoe last has an ‘E’ fitting. We encourage customers that are undecided to purchase 2 pairs in different sizes and send 1 pair back using our free UK returns service.

Our shoes are a natural leather product, due to this please expect some slight colour migration during wear. Regular cleaning and polishing of your shoes will maintain the suppleness of the leathers and enhance their good looks.

Suitable products can waterproof and weather protect your shoes. Please don’t wear your shoes in the rain until they have been worn 3 or 4 times. If you do get them wet remember to use shoe-trees and let them dry naturally at room temperature for about 2-3 days. Do not dry near the oven, open fire or radiator. As the leather dries it can adopt odd shapes if they aren’t in shoe-trees. Wet sole leather wears out twice as quickly so the drying period is important.

With regards to our women's shoes: the soles are currently made from TPR which is a synthetic rubber. At the moment, this is the construction for all of our women’s soles.

We are working on a new women's range which utilizes full Rubber outsoles, but currently we do not have an official release date for these styles.

With regards to our men's soles, the majority of our styles use full rubber soles. The only exceptions to this are 'Cartmel' and 'Ancoats.'

The only other use of synthetic materials are a small amount of padding we use in between the insock and the insole. We use this for comfort. This is a mix of natural rubber and synthetic rubber. We also use a small amount of PU between the lasting board and the outsole.

    title: 'New styles on the way!',
    text: "Over the last 6 months we have been very busy behind the scenes developing a new range of business-casual shoes and boots, for both men and women. The latest styles are by far and away our most technically advanced in terms of specification and materials used. The new styles will be released exclusively to our newsletter subscribers first on Saturday 4 April. We plan to ship all orders WC 20 April. For teaser photos please follow our social media pages over the next 7 days.In the upcoming range we have introduced new improved leathers which are noticeably thicker. We have previously used leather thickness in the region of 0.8mm-1.2mm, we have now increased this up to 1.6mm-1.8mm and also introduced full leather lining throughout all styles. The new thick leather increases the weight of the shoes slightly and means the shoes will take a little longer to break in, however they will feel much sturdier and will last many more years as a result of these changes.Increasing the quality and spec of our new shoes and boots means a slight increase in our pricing, however we are confident our customers will not be disappointed with the changes we have made. Matt, Head of Design, has grafted tirelessly to create designs that we are very proud of and excited to release. Over the last 12 months Matt has worked at many markets, events and our Whalley Warehouse shop, talking to and learning from our customers face to face. This provides him with vital information for the LANX range building. The new range is a combination of Matt's design skills and also suggestions given to us by LANX customers.A notable mention is the return of some highly requested Women's styles, with a new and improved twist. Our very popular Robinson boot from last year has returned (new name 'Chipping') with some slight alternations, design tweaks and a new rubber sole.Another exciting development is the introduction of larger sizes in men’s, now up to UK 14, and also women’s, now up to UK 9.In addition to our soon to be released collection of business-casual footwear we also recently launched a range of handmade sneakers. The reception has been fantastic and within the first few weeks a number of styles and sizes have already sold out. Below is a video from the sneaker factory which gives you a taste of the sneakers highly quality and meticulous attention to detail during production.",

    title: 'LANX x New York',
    text: "Like all LANX shoe collections, the soon to be released Spring Summer 2019 (“SS19”) range is inspired by an overseas  adventure, which is where we get our  “international influence” from.I chose New York for a few different reasons; I needed some catch up beers with a mate living in the city, I wanted to spend time with some excellent bespoke shoemakers I'd been made aware of, and I booked myself on to a highly respected shoe making course at the Brooklyn Shoe Space.Keiko, the lady who runs the Brooklyn Shoe Space, is a lovely and knowledgeable shoe craftswoman, I can highly recommend her courses. She has created a relaxed vibe and creative space for people with an interest in shoe making. It was nice meeting and working alongside people with various footwear interests; from brogues, to high heels, to sneakers.Thank you also to Anne and Markia who let me into their personal shoe workshops in Brooklyn, and also Jon from Oliver Moore Bootmakers in Manhattan, for allowing me to spend time with his dedicated staff and learn more about his family’s shoe making history.   New York is a surprisingly chilled out city with plenty of places to think, plan and be inspired. Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is a nice creative neighbourhood to stay or relax in, with interesting people and good coffee in abundance.Below is a photo of our new Park boot in distressed brown leather, absolute belter don't you think?",
